# Dynamic Website Builder 🚀

A dynamic website builder created using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript that demonstrates how reusable cards can be generated dynamically using DOM manipulation instead of static HTML.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a dynamic UI where structured cards are created using JavaScript functions. Each card displays a video-style layout including a thumbnail, title, channel name, views, upload time, and duration. The cards are generated programmatically, making the layout reusable and scalable.

---

## ✨ Features

- Dynamic generation of reusable cards using JavaScript  
- Automatic formatting of views (K / M)  
- Thumbnail display with duration overlay  
- Clean and minimal UI layout  
- No frameworks or libraries used  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 – Page structure  
- CSS3 – Styling and layout  
- Vanilla JavaScript – DOM manipulation and logic

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The HTML contains a main container where cards are injected.  
- JavaScript uses a function to generate markup dynamically.  
- Template literals are used to construct the structure.  
- CSS handles layout, spacing, and overlay elements like video duration.
